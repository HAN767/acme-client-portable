ACME-CLIENT(1)            BSD General Commands Manual           ACME-CLIENT(1)

NAME
     acme-client — ACME client

SYNOPSIS
     acme-client [-Fnrv] [-f configfile] domain

DESCRIPTION
     acme-client is an Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
     client: it looks in its configuration for a domain section corresponding
     to the domain given as command line argument and uses that configuration
     to retrieve an X.509 certificate which can be used to provide domain name
     validation (i.e. prove that the domain is who it says it is).  The cer‐
     tificates are typically used to provide HTTPS for web servers, but can be
     used in any situation where domain name validation is required (such as
     mail servers).

     If the certificate already exists and is less than 30 days from expiry,
     acme-client attempts to renew the certificate.

     In order to prove that the client has access to the domain, a challenge
     is issued by the signing authority.  acme-client implements the “http-01”
     challenge type, where a file is created within a directory accessible by
     a locally run web server.  The default challenge directory /var/www/acme
     can be served by httpd(8) with this location block, which will properly
     map response challenges:

           location "/.well-known/acme-challenge/*" {
                   root "/acme"
                   request strip 2
           }

     The options are as follows:

     -F      Force certificate renewal, even if it's too soon.

     -f configfile
             Specify an alternative configuration file.

     -n      No operation: check and print configuration.

     -r      Revoke the X.509 certificate.

     -v      Verbose operation.  Specify twice to also trace communication and
             data transfers.

     domain  The domain name.

FILES
     /etc/acme              Private keys for acme-client.
     /etc/acme-client.conf  Default configuration.
     /var/www/acme          Default challengedir.

EXIT STATUS
     acme-client returns 0 if certificates were changed (revoked or updated),
     1 on failure, or 2 if the certificates didn't change (up to date).

EXAMPLES
     Example configuration files for acme-client and httpd(8) are provided in
     /etc/examples/acme-client.conf and /etc/examples/httpd.conf.

     To generate a certificate for example.com and use it to provide HTTPS,
     create acme-client.conf and httpd.conf and run:

           # acme-client -v example.com && rcctl reload httpd

     A cron(8) job can renew the certificate as necessary.  On renewal,
     httpd(8) is reloaded:

           0       *       *       *       *       sleep $((RANDOM \% 2048)) && \
                   acme-client example.com && rcctl reload httpd
